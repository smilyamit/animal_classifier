#1 Reverse orer flow (From coder persception)
  Buid CNN model --> save model -->Prediction ? (with the help of API, as API will take care of Prediction)
  prediction--> API--> how to send input to API--->(using GUI)
  
 #2 User Perception
 Upload the img--> clcik predict---API wil read the input convert into base 64 string---> again converted by API to pixel & save
 locally saved img fed to our model-->Prediction (as per algo)--> send to GUI
 
 #3 API? 
 Building API
 API (related to web) or web api is something which is called over a network (Intranet, Internet)
 Those which is called over a network is called web services
 Who make Webservices: web application development framework make webservices
 Framework-->collection of libraries--> collection of methods --- which helps to build web api
 
 Note: Different things is happening whenever there is interaction of your program (app) with network eg api routing, path 
      generation, temp databse allocation, Secured Socket lay etc which is taken care by built in framework (eg django, flask)
      on which you have createde web api
      
#4 Flask?
 -Light WADF
 -3 important things in any web api (MVC)
 - In flask (MVT)
  1 GUI (template) 2 Backend (view)  3 Data Model or database arch(Model)
  eg any project like CRM 
  -GUI
  -Backend fun (Add customer, update customer, search customer)
  - Databse model - For answering DB query
  * in view(backend): we have routes (its nothing but path for each specific query, eg \add customer)
==>  So when customer click update button (in template) then route (in view) will activate its path to DB model (Model),  
  DB model read the query n search for specific query
